To check the variance we use $\\mathbf{E}[(x-\\mu)^2] = \\sigma^2$ and thus the transformed variable has unit variance.

    "The k-fold cross-validation was introduced in the section where we discussed how to deal with [“Model Selection, Underfitting and Overfitting\"](underfit-overfit.md). We will put this to good use to select the model design and to adjust the hyperparameters. We first need a function that returns the i-th fold of the data in a k-fold cros-validation procedure. It proceeds by slicing out the i-th segment as validation data and returning the rest as training data. Note - this is not the most efficient way of handling data and we would use something much smarter if the amount of data was considerably larger. But this would obscure the function of the code considerably and we thus omit it."

    "1. Can you improve your model by minimizing the log-price directly? What happens if you try to predict the log price rather than the price?\n",
    "1. Is it always a good idea to replace missing values by their mean? Hint - can you construct a situation where the values are not missing at random?\n",
    "1. Find a better representation to deal with missing values. Hint - What happens if you add an indicator variable?\n",
    "1. Improve the score on Kaggle by tuning the hyperparameters through k-fold crossvalidation.\n",
    "1. Improve the score by improving the model (layers, regularization, dropout).\n",
    "1. What happens if we do not standardize the continuous numerical features like we have done in this section?\n",

    "Note for converting this notebook into PDF. If you use 'File -> Download as -> PDF', you may get the error that svg cannot converted because inkscape is not installed and cannot find PNG images. The easiest way is printing this notebook as a PDF in your browser. Or, you can install inkscape to convert SVG (On macOS, you may `brew cask install xquartz inkscape`, on Ubuntu, you may `sudo apt-get install inkscape`) and change the image URL to local filenames. "
